                 <b>I am passionate disruptive innovation oriented technological 
                 an sustainable development for Latin America & Caribe.</b> 
                 Ecuadorian by birth, I have lived in several countries, 
                 which has give me a wide vision, understanding mindsets and 
                 adaptation to different cultures, going for different countries 
                 and fields as the Advertising, Strategic Communication, Open 
                 Innovation, Cinema Production, Programming and Enterpreneurship.

                  <p>I consider myself a ideallistic business developer. I would
                  call myself a High Tech Enterpreneur. I know enough to hire
                  the right people for the job and expand the network. I totally
                  understand why full stack software developers get tight when
                  they hear artificial intelligence.</p>
                   <p>
                  Startup Culture and hightech ecosystem is the ice breaker on the internet era. There are
                  millions of reasons to think about new brand or
                  re-branding native based or platform and almost everyone at
                  some point got suckered into buying a domain for 1.99 and
                  thought they could build a great site that will make them
                  millions of dollars in 15 minutes on WIX or Square Space😉.
                  They were fooled.

                      Personally, like a Communications Engineer and Audiovisual 
                      Arts Producer background, SEO has gotten me out of 
                      some huge financial jams. I've collected few watermarked 
                      test photos and DSLR back ground B-Roll
                      videos with the new mocked up logo I just designed for my 
                      clients on a landing page.

                  <p>
                    The elephant in the room is that the advantage to being savvy
                     in responsive code is that there is a market for these companies 
                     that either can afford or simply just don't want to pay a software 
                     developer $6k-$10k a month to build a website with custom web 
                     applications but they will set aside a $1500-$10k+ budget for 
                     professional photos, videos, web setup, css/html theme customization, 
                     scale-able hosting plan with dedicated email marketing solutions, 
                     social media API key integration, google business integration 
                     (google maps), eCommerce solutions, call to action links, surveys 
                     (survey monkey) and I can contact you for give forms and then set 
                     aside a monthly retainer to manage and market it.

                       web rankings. You can source content development through platforms like 
                       CRM Salesforce and use tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to make sure your articles are SEO 
                       so friendly. I can also help my clients to write weekly content for 
                       their blogs which help with google rankings, then share those articles 
                       on the major social media platforms to grow their brand.

                     brand professionally photographed with custom graphic design
                      displayed on their own website with the domain they've bought

                        on earth. Use your skills as conversation starters to find out where 
                        you can help new prospects and network like crazy. Stay affordable 
                        and reasonable in the beginning. I can always start with shoot of
                        CEO photo shoot to break the ice and get to the decision maker
                        and pitch the re-brand with new photos. My goal is to get leverage 
                        to you can weed out the cheap high maintenance difficult clients 
                         and keep the good ones.

                        I can may run into your business partner with a strong vision by company 
                        gets results and you want to sold a new product. I include a first right 
                        with a worthy amount that includes a percentage of all future income 
                        or you can keep you on the e-comerce platform sells. I can become your
                         full agency and get a percentage of the year contract.

                     Some businesses will need custom back-end solutions like client 
                      management portals, project management portals, booking software 
                      (Booksy) and invoice software. Guess what you get for those 
                      custom solutions, and you get to up-sell a training agreement 
                      for your client’s staff and future new hires. Some clients will
                      want you to help them so they can buy.
