                      Technosystem, from the generation of a revolutionary
                      innovation, the transistor in its relationship with
                      Stanford University and the fourth industrial revolution
                      In the business world, Technosystems and emerging
                      companies start, start or set up a new business under
                      construction supporting their efforts in technology. They
                      are ideas that innovate the market and seek to facilitate
                      the complicated processes associated with innovation, the
                      development of web technologies and venture capital. We
                      have studied the creators of the transistor; John Bardeen,
                      William Shockley and Walter Brattain who converged in Palo
                      Alto California US.

                     <p>Humanity leapt forward into the deepest social upheaval and

                       it, she is dedicated to building an extraordinarily new civilization.
                        The first great revolution was that of agriculture, the industrial 
                        revolution the second and the digital revolution the third.
                         The Third Industrial Revolution A Radical New Sharing Economy 
                         poses a radical turning point in which many efforts and the 
                         construction of urban habitats converge, due to its high impact 
                         on the local and global economy, based on new urban and technological 
                         criteria. </p>

                  The Silicon Valley of Hardware Future Cities shows how 3D technology is 
                  revolutionizing the world based on technological solutions applied to problems 
                  arising within the framework of different habitats, created on the basis of 
                  cutting-edge technology and innovation plus research and development, which 
                  drives the appearance of different governance imaginaries, designed to think 
                  about a new urban and technological scenario. An important aspect of being a 
                  smart habitat is the use of new digital technologies and the Internet of
                   Things (IoT) to improve processes for the benefit of residents.

                      The term Silicon Valley was coined by journalist Don C. Hoefler in 1971 in a
                       series of articles titled Silicon Valley USA in Electronic News. Silicon (Silicon),
                        refers to the high concentration of industries in the area, related to semiconductors 
                        and computers. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Silicon Valley refers to the Santa Clara Valley and the surroundings of the San 
                        Francisco Bay, where Stanford University, coupled with the vision of Frederick Terman, 
                        a professor at the same University, who considered that a vast unused area owned by the 
                        university would be perfect for real estate and intellectual development and established 
                        program to encourage graduate students to stay there, providing them with venture capital.
                         One of the main successes in the history of the program was to convince two graduates:
                          William Hewlett and David Packard, to stay around Stanford, both of which would create
                           HP Hewlett-Packard.
                      </li>
                     
                      <li>
                        The techno-industrial hyperdevelopment model of '' Silicon Valley '' began its locomotion in 
                        the 1960s, as a new era broke through. Suddenly a new form of scientific and technological
                         development broke out, its epicenter was Stanford University, and thanks to the facilities 
                         in the legislation for the creation of companies and the support of seed and venture capital,
                          new techno-social opportunities arose, until reaching a global impact, one of the first startups 
                          to emerge is the IBM International Business Machine.

                  <p>
                     Startup companies emerged from warehouses or garages in various places to become a giant like IBM or INTEL, 
                     thanks to the fact that their productive activity was inserted in information technology and dot-com 
                     services. With adequate conditions of connectivity and progressive access of the population to
                      telecommunications and electronics services, a process of productive chain unprecedented in human 
                      history could be unleashed.

                      With the result of this research, it was sought to understand the Silicon
                    Valley model, since it can have a high impact on the industrial technological 
                    development of Ecuador, generating an appropriate context for the emergence 
                    of Technosystems and Startups based on the indicator development model i + D + i.
                    I have always considered it important to study technosystems and startups in order 
                    to analyze the role played by the Silicon Valley (US) development model as an agent
                     of scientific-technological technification, relevant for the development of Latin 
                     America and the Caribbean. The proposed study will help, among other aspects,
                    to know the innovation - technology relationship within the framework of a
                      possible alternative to the problem of technological development in Ecuador,
                      knowing the characteristics of the model from its epicenter at Stanford 
                      University in Palo Alto CA, to understand the development of the Silicon Valley
                      technosystem in the San Francisco Bay CA in the United States of North America
                       and its impact on the emerging economies of Latin America and the Caribbean.

                   From this moment on, a wide range of traditional industries such as the military, 
                   or aerospace joined the new emerging companies or Startups that were developed, 
                   the transistor took the technologies of IBM, APPLE, INTEL, GENERAL ELECTRIC, 
                   among many others. The city model adopted by the Santa Clara Valley in California 
                   (US) entailed the creation of different governance environments, creating objective
                    and subjective conditions for the emergence of innovation and development of companies

                      of the digital age, one morning in June 1956, where young scientists 
                      and experienced engineers converged in the city of San Francisco CA
                       who had worked in a semiconductor laboratory in the Outside of
                        Palo Alto, to develop with high-level researchers, an innovation 
                        that would transform the world forever, this invention was the transistor.

                <p>
                  I consider myself a ideallistic business developer. I would
                  call myself a High Tech Enterpreneur. I know enough to hire
                  the right people for the job and expand the netwo. I totally
                  understand why full stack software developers get tight when
                  they hear artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Innovation is the best ice breaker on the internet. Their are
                  millions of people who need help with their new brand or
                  re-branding period like a free platform and almost everyone at
                  some point got suckered into buying a domain for 1.99 and
                  thought they could build a great site that will make them
                  millions of dollars in 15 minutes on WIX or Square Space😉.
                  They were fooled.
